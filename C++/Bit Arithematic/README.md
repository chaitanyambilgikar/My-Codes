Bit Arithmetic
==============
This directory contains implementations of some of the basic bit-manipulation questions that are used in interviews.

* ### `bit_change_required.cpp`
Returns the number of bits that must be changed (0 to 1 or vice-versa) to convert a number A to B.

  __Example__
  
  A sample run of the program yields the following:
  
  ```
  Enter the first number: 10
  
  Enter the second number: 30
  
  The number of bit changes required to change 10 to 30 are: 2
  ```
  
* ### `float_to_binary.cpp`

	Returns the binary representation of a floating point number.
	
	__Example__
	
	A sample run of the program yields the following:
	
	```
	Enter a floating point number: 10.05
	
	INT: 10 DEC: 0.0500002
	
	Binary representation of Integer part (read right to left): 0101
	
	Binary representation of fractional part: 00001
	```
