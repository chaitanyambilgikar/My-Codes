/**
 * This class contains all the methods to get the final scores of a list of students
 * 
 *  
 *  Given a list of test results (each with a test date, Student ID, and the student’s Score), return the Final Score for each student. A student’s Final Score is calculated as the average of his/her 5 highest test scores. You can assume each student has at least 5 test scores. 

You may use the JDK or the standard template library. The solution will be evaluated on correctness, runtime complexity (big-O), and adherence to coding best practices. A complete answer will include the following: 

Document your assumptions 
Explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem 
Provide code comments where applicable 
Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer. 
Identify any additional data structures you used and justify why you used them. 

class TestResult{ 
int studentId; 
Date testDate; 
int testScore; 
} 

public Map<Integer, Double> getFinalScores(List<TestResult> resultList){ 
return null; 
}
